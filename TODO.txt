    - Query the two metrics EVERY DAY!
    - Write down all of the 'legal' application names in 'legal_pod_names' in util.
    - Implement some forecasting methods.
    - Delete dated data (already have backup for the seconds).
    - Write pipeline API for the project (This can be really fun - not so little work also..).
