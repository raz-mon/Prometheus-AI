

Todo:
    - Query the two metrics EVERY DAY!
    - Write function we talked about on the 7.6.2022 (total pipeline basically).
      What's left is to write forecast_ts (and some extras) and change methods implementation accordingly.
      We want each forecasting method from the ones I implemented to return the forecast, and the error.
    - Write down all of the 'legal' application names in 'legal_pod_names' in util (for CPU and memory separetely).
    - Can make a nice MENU, so that the user will know from what methods he can choose. This can be nice!
    - Implement more forecasting methods (Add some deep ones).
    - Write readme.md file in repository.
    - Write report, make poster.
    - Write documentation of the code (for all functions).
