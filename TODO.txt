- Query the two metrics EVERY DAY!

- Write down all of the 'legal' application names in 'legal_pod_names' in util.

- Write a function that aggregates all the application data.
    - Start with writing one for the new saving format (what isn't in the 'until...' directory).
    - Then aggregate that data as well.

- Make new directory of data resampled by hours (by mean).

- Implement some forecasting methods.

- Make functions that forecast forward (how many is an argument) for a given time-series.
    - Arguments:
        - How many time forward (in hours) - horizon.
        - What method to use (out of the ones I'll implement).
        - What else?

- Delete the dated data - no need of it! I'm using only the seconds data anyway - and it is backed up in Dropbox.
